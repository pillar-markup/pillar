Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:

For the Class part:  State the name of the class with one line description: For example, I'm xxx the root of the hierarchy of visitor objects.

For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibility, what I'm doing, what services do I offer.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them.
