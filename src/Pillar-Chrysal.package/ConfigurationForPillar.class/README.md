I'm a generated class that manages the conversion of configuration items written in STON format to Pharo objects. I'm used for example in Pillar to manage 'Pillar.conf' file.  

I was generated by the ChrysalConfigurationBuilder based on a list of item descriptions (instances of subclasses of ChrysalItem).
To help you remember from which configuration items I was generated from, I have a class side method which when executed in presence of the generating package will return a list of items. Note that such items only exist at compile time. Therefore executing this method with only the runtime does not make any sense.

chrysalDescriptions
 ^ STON fromString: '[
	StringConfigurationItem {
		#propertyName : #title,
		#default : 'my super cool book',
		#noDefault : false
	}, ... ]'


Now to exist and be used I do not need the full Chrysal package, just the runtime containing the ChrysalConfiguration class. Note that I may inherit from one of its subclasses to support better customisation.

	To generate me, a code snippet similar to the following one was executed: 
		
		ChrysalConfigurationBuilder new 
			configurationRootClass: ChrysalPillarishConfiguration;
			defineConfigurationClassNamed: #ConfigurationForPillar packagedIn: Pillar-Chrysal; 
			withDescriptionItems: ConfigurationDescriptionForXX itemDescriptionForXX
