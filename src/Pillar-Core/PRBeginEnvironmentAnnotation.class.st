I'm the beginning of annotation to represent an environment (as in LaTeX): typically ${begin:card}$ 
in the following example.

Here is for example an environment called card. 
It is composed of a begin and end environment annotations.

```language=Smalltalk
${begin:card}$

!! I'm Cool

A paragraph about the card.
I will be interpreted as part of the card.

${end:card}$ 
```
