I represent a pillar codeblock once it has been tested.

I am composed of a text, a result and an explanation.

The text shows the text of the codeblock I am linked to, the result is a boolean stating if the test has passed or not and the explanation is either 'Test passed', 'Test failed without raising an exception' or the exception raised by the test.

For example:
[[[ 
3+4
>>> 7
]]]

Given this codeblock, the associated PRBookTestResult's instance variable would be: 
text: ''3+4'
result: true 
explanation: 'Test passed'
